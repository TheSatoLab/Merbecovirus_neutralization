A study by Lin Pan, Yu Kaku, Jarel Elgin Tolentino, Yusuke Kosugi and Kei Sato

## Summary
This repository contains the multiple sequence alignment files, phylogenetic trees, and codes for analyzing the _Merbecovirus_ sequences used in the study.

## Contents
*  **phylogenetic_analysis:** a directory containing computational codes for phylogenetic analysis.
*  **output_files:** a directory containing all the aligned genome sequences, recombination-free sequences, receptor-binding domain sequences of the representative viruses, the reconstructed trees (raw), and other output files (raw).
